Both liveness & readiness probes are used to control the health of an application.
Failing liveness probe will restart the container,
whereas failing readiness probe will stop our application from serving traffic.


Here’s what this might look like in a real life failure scenario. Let’s say our API encounters a fatal exception when processing a request.
Readiness probe fails.
Kubernetes stops routing traffic to the pod.
Liveness probe fails.
Kubernetes restarts the failed container*.
Readiness probe succeeds.
Kubernetes starts routing traffic to the pod again.
