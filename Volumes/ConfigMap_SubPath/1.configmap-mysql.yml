  # Kubernetes took the map name of mysql_binlog_format.cnf present it as a file
    #with the contents that were stored in the data source of the configMap.
    #The problem however is it laid that volume on top of the existing directory.
    #The default configuration files for mysql are no longer present.
    #I'd have to create all the mysql configuration files and store them into the configMap.
    #Or, I can use a subPath.
