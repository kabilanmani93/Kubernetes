Unlike Blue/green deployments, Canary releases are based on the following assumptions:
   -Multiple versions of your application can exist together at the same time, getting live traffic.
   -If you donâ€™t use some kind of sticky session mechanism, some customers might hit a production server in one request and a canary server in another.
If you cannot guarantee these two points, then blue/green deployments are a much better approach for safe deployments.
